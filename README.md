# Effective-office

## Goal :dart:

The main goal of the project is the automation of various processes in the office and providing
interesting statistics for employees.

## Technical goal: :wrench:

The main technical task of the project is to create a multi-module application on Kotlin,
trying to focus on the most modern and relevant solutions in this language. Throughout the project,
we tried to use other languages and
technologies as little as possible.
