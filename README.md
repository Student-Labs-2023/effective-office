# Effective-office

## Goal :dart:

The main goal of the project is the automation of various processes in the office and providing
interesting statistics for employees.

## Technical goal: :wrench:

The main technical task of the project is to create a multi-module application on Kotlin,
trying to focus on the most modern and relevant solutions in this language. Throughout the project,
we tried to use other languages and
technologies as little as possible.

### Rules on commit messages' content

1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
   * Please make an extra effort to explain why changes are needed for every non-trivial modification.
2. If your pull request solves problem from the issues, please leave a link to it in the body of the pull request
3. If possible, try to avoid commits like *"Fixed after check "* and replace them with meaningful ones.
4. Keep the subject (the first line of the commit message) clean and readable. All additional information and directives for external tools 
should be moved to the body of the message.

### Rules on commit messages' style/formatting

1. Before the subject line, add a symbol to show what your commit contains
* [+] - Addition
* [-] - Delete 
* [~] - Fix, edit 
2. Separate subject from body with a blank line
3. Do not capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
