# Features :fire:

## Story

The subproject contains stories screen, which fetches data from notion database and displays actual info about effective employes, which may fit the definition of one of these story types:

### Birthdays: :birthday:

Show employee name, photo and congratulatory text.

### Anniversary of working for the company: :star:

Shows employee name, photo and congratulatory text, with the number of years with the company.

### New employee: :baby_chick:

Shows employee name and congratulatory text.

## Duolingo

Since a lot of people in the company are learning languages with the [Duolingo](https://ru.duolingo.com/) app, we decided to use their API to display the statistics for the week, thus motivating more people to start paying attention to learning new languages and do it more consistently. There are currently the following types of stories for duolingo:

### Duolingo top on XP: ðŸ¥‡

Shows duolingo top of employees by xp, with their names, photo, languages and all time XP.

### Duolingo top of the day in shock mode: âš¡

Shows duolingo top by number of days in stike mode.

The screen also contains buttons that can be used to interact with stories (switch, pause or resume). You can see them by pressing the down button on the remote control. The screen can be started in two formats: separate from all or be added to the autoplay to play with another screens, using autoplay menu.

## Leader ID Events :office:

The office of our company is located in the "boiling point" building, which hosts many interesting events every day. "Boiling point" has its own [api](https://apps.leader-id.ru/swagger/) for getting events. In order not to miss events that are interesting for employees, we use the boiling point api to receive and display information about events for the month. There is a qr on the screen to go to the registration site for the event.

## Mattermost messages :speech_balloon:

Our company uses Mattermost as a corporate messenger. Employees want to display their messages on the TV screen, for this a bot was developed that reads chats to which it is added. If an employee contacts the bot, the bot will add his message to storyes. If a message is marked with [importantMessageReaction](https://github.com/effectivemade/labs-office-elevator/blob/fc7c7a67f7f0009e336dda40d8ad2c57af657b82/tv-app/effecticeTV/app/src/main/java/band/effective/office/tv/domain/botLogic/BotConfig.kt#L6) , then the message will be shown immediately and will break the content being shown. If the message is marked with [deleteMessageReaction](https://github.com/effectivemade/labs-office-elevator/blob/fc7c7a67f7f0009e336dda40d8ad2c57af657b82/tv-app/effecticeTV/app/src/main/java/band/effective/office/tv/domain/botLogic/BotConfig.kt#L7), then the message will be unsubscribed. Also, the bot can be asked to creep the message until a certain day.
